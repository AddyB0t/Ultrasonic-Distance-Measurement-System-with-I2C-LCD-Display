# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-System-with-I2C-LCD-Display
This project implements a real-time distance measurement system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The measured distance is displayed on an I2C LCD screen, providing an intuitive way to detect and measure the distance to objects in the environment.
